### Why this blog?

- **Write to learn.**  Turning vague hunches into words forces clarity.  
- **Pay it forward.** I learnt backend craft from generous strangersâ€™ posts; time to add my brick to the wall.  
- **Build a reference.** When on-call Mohab forgets an arcane SQL tweak at 3 a.m., blog-post Mohab will have documented it.

### Off-hours
