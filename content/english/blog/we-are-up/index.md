## A quick hello 👋

Every developer reaches a point where the notes folder, the pile of Craft/Trello/Notion pages and the “one day I’ll publish this” snippets begin to **creak under their own weight**. This blog is me finally hitting the _publish_ button.

I called the kickstart post **“Going Up”** because pressing that elevator button is the smallest possible action that commits you to motion. The doors are closing—let’s rise.

## Who am I, anyway?

- **Day job:** Backend engineer at **MaxAB**, wrangling micro-services that move groceries across Egypt.
- **Fuel:** Double-shot espresso (don’t judge), with literal **Nile** water running outside the office window and old J-pop music.  
- **Why I write:** Teaching shakes bugs out of your mental cache. If a concept can survive the odyssey from brain → keyboard → RSS feed, it’s probably solid.

## What you can expect here

| Theme | Sample Topics in the Pipeline |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| **Resilient Backends** | High-level and low-level system design topics • Communications protocols like grpc and graphql |
| **Data & Storage** | Database concurrency • Query optimization • Database internals  |
| **Observability** | Prometheus → Grafana the painless way • Structured logging patterns |
| **Dev Life** | Debug-driven learning • Balancing night-owl coding with sunrise stand-ups • Opinion posts |
| **“Coffee Break” Reads** | Architecture tales, book notes, snippets that amused me |

_Publishing rhythm:_ **Fortnightly**. Short, focused, field-tested.

## My first promise: keep it **human**

- No copy-pasted docs.
- Attaching diagrams as I could to help clear the ideas.
- Honest root cause when things explode.

## Call to action

1. **Subscribe** (see that fancy newsletter box below). I’ll never spam—just one concise email per post.
2. **Say hi** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mohab_abd) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mohab-abd). What topics burn the most CPU cycles in your head?
3. **Ship something.** Close the tab, write a test, refactor a nasty switch-case. Then return and tell me how it went.

### Until next time…

I appreciate you taking this quick ride in the backend elevator with me.
The doors are opening, but the learning never stops.

**Onward and upward!**
